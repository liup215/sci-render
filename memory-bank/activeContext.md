# Active Context

## Current Focus
SVG vector export is implemented and verified. The toolbar now has an "Export SVG" button that generates a true SVG document from the active slide's objects, including rectangles, circles, text, lines, arrows, images, paths, and groups. Rendering mirrors the Konva canvas: transforms follow `translate → rotate → scale`, arrowheads use SVG `<marker>` definitions, and multi-line text is emitted as `<tspan>` elements. The generated SVG downloads as `<slide-name>.svg`.

## Decisions Made
- Tech stack: React + TypeScript + Vite + react-konva + Zustand.
- Repository root: `C:\Users\22569\Documents\20-Projects\sci-render`.
- Git remote: public GitHub repo `liup215/sci-render`, default branch `main`.
- Keyboard shortcuts are global and ignored while typing in inputs.
- The right panel uses tabs (Properties / Layers) to avoid adding another panel and keep layout compact.
- Layer list is shown top-to-bottom (highest z-index first) with row selection and ordering buttons.
- Undo/redo snapshots exclude the history stacks and transient guides.
- `persist` partialize excludes `past`/`future` so history is reset on reload.
- Rulers are drawn on HTML `<canvas>` overlays using a 20px grid layout; they respond to `zoom` and `stagePos` from the store.
- Grid lines are rendered as independent `Line` nodes to avoid unintended connecting strokes.
- Inline text editing uses an HTML `<textarea>` absolutely positioned with the same transform (position, scale, rotation) as the Konva Text node; edits commit via `updateObject`.
- Text tool creates the object on mouseup and immediately enters edit mode; select-tool double-click also enters edit mode.
- SVG export is generated manually from the Zustand store rather than rasterized from Konva; this keeps output as true vectors and supports all current object types without adding server-side rendering.

## Next Steps
1. Choose the next MVP feature (advanced drawing tools, additional export formats, or UI polish).
2. Continue incremental implementation with build + browser verification.
3. Commit and push after each feature slice.

## Open Questions
- Whether to add Tailwind or another UI library after MVP core is stable.
- Whether to persist files locally (IndexedDB) or add backend later.
